  <h1>OpenSplice DDS</h1>


  <p>
    OpenSplice DDS is a very high-performance, real-time, data-centric
    publish/subscribe middleware platform. It uniquely combines data-centric
    and real-time publish/subscribe features to provide next generation
    mission and business critical applications with the ideal platform for
    achieving high performance data distribution and management.
  </p>
  <p>
    OpenSplice DDS complies with the full profile of the 
    “OMG Data Distribution Service (DDS) for Real-Time Systems v1.2 Specification”,
    as it provides a complete implementation of both the 
    “Data Centric Publish/Subscribe” (DCPS) Layer, and of the 
    “Data Local Reconstruction Layer” (DLRL) Layer. This sets OpenSplice DDS as the
    leading OMG DDS-compliant COTS product available on the market.
  </p>
  <p>
    OpenSplice DDS has been developed and optimized over years of research and
    development along with deployments in the most demanding mission and business
    critical distributed applications, such as, Combat Management Systems (CMS),
    Air Traffic Management/Control (ATM/C), Transportation, Telecommunications
    and Financial Services.
  </p>
