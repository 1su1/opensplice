            <b>Query parser doesn't support escape characters</b><br/>
            <i>
              The internal OpenSplice DDS query parser does not support escape characters. This 
              implicates that specific tokens cannot be used in query expressions (like 
              for instance SQL keywords 'select', 'where', etc).<br/>
              Impact at API level:
              <ul>
                <li>Topics with a SQL keyword as name cannot be created</li>
                <li>
                  QueryCondition expressions cannot refer to datafields with SQL keyword as name
                </li>
                <li>
                  ContentFilteredTopic expressions cannot refer to datafields with SQL keyword as name
                </li>

              When a type support object is created with an type name which is not known in
              the meta database, the following register_type function crashes.

            <b>idlpp cannot handle same struct in a struct or forward declarations to structs</b><br/>
            <i>
            The following (faulty) idl code generates a 'floating point exception', instead idlpp should
            not allow such constructs.
            <pre><code>
            struct TestStruct;

            struct TestStruct{
                long x;
                TestStruct someEnum;
                string val;
            };
            </code></pre>
            The following idl also fails (the forward declaration to the TestStruct is not correctly
            processed):
            <pre><code>
            struct TestStruct;

            struct TestStruct1{
                TestStruct y;
            };

            struct TestStruct{
                long x;
            };
            </code></pre>
            with the error: <code>***DDS parse error TestStruct undefined at line: 4</code>. The
            following idl construct is not allowed, however the IDL preprocessor does not give 
            a clear error:
            <pre><code>
            struct TestStruct;

            struct TestStruct1{
                TestStruct y;
            };

            struct TestStruct{
                TestStruct1 x;
            };

            <i>
              ospl_projgen will generate projects which will build incorrectly if it is supplied an output
              directory ( -o option ) in which the final part of the path matches the name of one of the 
              address spaces being generated. <br>
              e.g. ospl_projgen ... -t mmstat -o path/mmstat<br>
              These projects appear to build correctly however the final image will be incorrect.<br>
              Other names to avoid currently are inetserver, ivfs_server, ResourceStore, spliced,

              be tidied in future releases.

              The library name for the report plugin can be blank but if it is blank
              then an error occurs in existing code when trying to resolve function
              names, this error causes a failure.

            <b>Application with listeners does not terminate</b><br/>
            <i>
              When an application attach listeners, then it does not terminate and just hangs after the main thread finished.
              This occurs in both java and c++.
              <br>Workaround is to delete all the DCPS objects (Datareaders, listeners, Topics...) before terminating your application.
