    This page contains a list of all bugfixes and changes incorporated in
    OpenSplice V6.x series of releases<br>

    <h2><a name="highlights">Release Highlights</a></h2>
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V6.3OSS contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Durability Service has new pluggable persistent stores. In previous
      versions, XML was allowed on all platforms and Memory Mapped File was also
      available on Linux only. From V6.3OSS, Memory Mapped File is now deprecated.
      The new persistence stores are:</li>
      <ul>
         <li><a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLLite</a></li>
         <li><a href="https://code.google.com/p/leveldb/">LevelDB</a></li>
      </ul>
      <li>The ISO C++ API (beta) has had a new set of features added. See the 
      <a href="../isocpp/html/index.html">ISO C++ Release Notes</a> for further details</li>
      </li>
    </ul>  
    </p>
      
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V6.3.0 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Record and Replay is taken out of beta and now considered a GA service. It
      includes the following new features:</li>
      <ul>
         <li>Compitability with the DDSI2/DDSI2E Services.</li>
         <li>The ability to remove record and/or replay interest without stopping a scenario.</li>
         <li>The ability to clear the contents of a storage during a scenario.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>DDSI2 and DDSI2E are now taken out of beta and considered as GA services.
          In completing the work on
          DDSI2 and DDSI2E, which includes adding support for IPV6, there has been a change
          to the configuration options. In all previous versions DDSI2 and DDSI2E 
          used "Unsupported". This has now been changed to "Internal". Old configuration
          files will still be supported on V6 series, but a WARNING message
          will be raised to highlight the deprecated "Unsupported". The Internal
          configuration parameters are marked as such as they are subject to change
          in the future. </li>
      <li>A beta version of the ISO C++ PSM for DDS is now available. Documentation on
      what is supported in this beta version is available <a href="../../docs/isocpp/html/index.html">here.</a>
      <li>Performance optimisation for Java and C++ DataReaders to allow them to
      specify the number of threads to use when demarshalling data. Demarshalling
      data to a language-binding specific format can take considerable processing
      depending on the type of the data. Before this change this process was single-threaded
      and would therefore limit throughput, especially on multi-core platforms.
      See OSPL-1078 in the API changes section.</li>
      <li>The ospl tool is enhanced (see ospl -help for detailed info). It no
      longer returns negative error nunbers. Its default is no longer stop, but -help.</li>   
      <li>Support for kernel mode is added to the RTP support for VxWorks V6 series.</li>
      <li>Support for SMP (Symmetric MultiProcessing) on VxWorks V6 series.</li>
      <li>DLRL is deprecated. It will be removed from the product at V6.4.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V6.2.3 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Support for PikeOS 3.1.7 on PowerPC for Windows hosts. For more information click <a href="win-pike.html">here</a>.
      <li>Support for VxWorks 6.9 on Pentium for Windows hosts.</li>
      <li>Support for VxWorks 6.9 on Pentium3 for Windows hosts.</li>
      <li>Support for VxWorks 6.9 on PowerPC P1010/P1013 for Windows hosts.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V6.2.2 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Support for PikeOS 3.3. As part of this, the PikeOS port builds against
      the BSD Posix library rather than the NewLib implementation which is removed
      in 3.3.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Changes to the way read- and take-operations access data. The read- and
      take-operations now provide data circularly, meaning that these operations
      will &apos;resume&apos; a previous read just as if read_next_instance was
      successively called. This way all instances can be read even when for
      example lower key-values get updated between two read-operations with a
      max_samples limit.</li>
      <li>Support has been added for kernel mode for VxWorks 6.8 PENTIUM4 target.</li>
      <li>Support has been added for SMP kernels for the VxWorks 6.8 PENTIUM4 kernel
      mode build.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <ul>
     <li>Adds configurability for data compression in the networking service.
     This allows tuning of the existing (zlib) method, adds two alternative
     fast compressors (lzf and snappy) and provides a plugin api for using
     other mechanisms.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Recording and Replay Service (beta version)<br><br>
      A second beta version of PrismTech's new recording and replay service. This version
      supports:
      <ul>
         <li>Replay the recorded data with different speeds</li>
         <li>The ability to add time conditions to a command that can delay its processing</li>
         <li>Statistics on the record and replay of data</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V6.2.0 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <h4>New product add-ons:</h4>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>DDSI-Extended (ddsi2e):
      DDSI2E is a new beta version of the extended version of PrismTech's DDSI2
      networking service, giving extra features for:
      <ul>
      <li>Network partitions : Network partitions provide the ability to use
      alternative multicast addresses for combinations of DCPS topics and partitions
      to separate out traffic flows, for example for routing or load reduction.</li>
      <li>Security : Encryption can be configured per network partition. This allows
      configuring encrypted transmission for subsets of the data.</li>
      <li>Bandwidth limiting and traffic scheduling : Any number of "network channels"
      can be defined, each with an associated transport priority. Application data
      is routed via the network channel with the best matching priority. For each
      network channel, outgoing bandwidth limits can be set and the IP "differentiated services"
      options can be controlled.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>OpenSplice Streams :
      OpenSplice Streams API supports a common data-distribution pattern where
      continuous flows or streams of data have to be transported with minimal overhead
      and therefore maximal achievable throughput. For more information see the
      <a href="../pdf/OpenSplice_refman_Streams.pdf">
      OpenSplice Streams Reference Manual</a>.</li><br>
      <li>Recording and Replay Service (beta version)<br><br>
      A first version of PrismTech's new recording and replay service. This version
      supports:
      <ul>
         <li>Record topics to an xml storage</li>
         <li>Manipulate the recorded data</li>
         <li>Ability to control the recording and replay service remotely</li>
         <li>A new tool (seperate installer) to drive the recording and replay service and view its output.</li>
      </ul>
      </li><br>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Other new features:</h4>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Extensible and Dynamic Topic Types annotations now handled in IDL :
      As a first step to the implementation of the OMG standard for
      Extensible and Dynamic Topic Types for DDS, a developer can now annotate their
      IDL as per the specification and when the implementation of the specification
      becomes available (OpenSplice DDS V7) then no further IDL changes should be
      required.
      </li><br>
      <li>OpenSplice RMI extensions:
      <ul>
         <li>Instances Management: Requests/Replies topic instances are per-client basis.
         The topic key is {client_name, client_instance}. To support multithreaded clients
         a configuration option named '--RMIClientThreadingModel' has been added to take two
         possible values 'ST' (Single Thread) or 'MT' (Multi Thread). The MT option will set
         the history qos to KEEP_ALL and allow then the client to be multithreaded.</li>
         <li>Service activation: The server activation has been changed to decouple the service
         activation from the service registration. This activation supports two modes: a blocking mode
         where the run operation blocks the calling thread, and a non blocking mode where
         the calling thread can perform other tasks after calling "run".</li>
         <li>Error handling and exceptions: Error reporting has been enhanced with the definition of two new exceptions :
         INTERNAL_ERROR to report any internal operation failure and SERVICE_NOT_FOUND
         to report the failure to find a requested service.</li>
         <li>The default Replies waiting timeout has beed increased to 10min (it was set to 1millisec).</li>
         <li>Asynchronous invocation mode has been added, which is similar to the CORBA
         Asynchronous Messaging Interface (AMI) call-back model, in addition to
         the conventional synchronous mode. The RMI documentation has been
         updated and new examples (Printer and HelloWorld) have been added to
         illustrate the usage of this invocation mode.</li>
      </ul><br>
      For more information see the <a href="../pdf/OpenSplice_RMI_GettingStarted.pdf">
      OpenSplice RMI GettingStarted Guide</a>.</li><br>
      </li><br>
      <li>Windows Services improvements and it is now able to write to the System Event Log, for more details see OSPL-593 below.
      </li><br>
      <br>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Potential upgrade change:</h4>
    <p>
    <ul><li>In previous releases only a subset of the OpenSplice CORBA co-habitation DCPS Java API (dcpscj.jar) was
    generated using a CORBA ORB. Starting from this release (issue ospl-347), the entire CORBA-Java API is generated
    by the ORB IDL compiler. This enables customers to use internal types like ReturnCode_t and InstanceHandle_t in
    a CORBA environment, i.e. Helper and Holder classes are now available for those types as well. This changes the
    steps required to process your application Topic definition IDL files, to compile the generated and application
    source code, to run applications, and how Listener classes must be written. Additionally extra care must be taken
    not to mix the CORBA and Standalone DCPS APIs on the same compilation or VM classpath.
    <ul><li>IDL to Java code generation changes
    <p>Given the below IDL defintion:<br><br>
    /* @file: Foo.idl */<br>
    struct Bar {/<br>
        long key;/<br>
    };/<br>
    #pragma keylist Bar key/<br>
    </p>
    <p>At OSPL 6.1 the required CORBA-Java DCPS code-generation steps were:
    <br><br>
    1 / $JACORB_HOME/bin/idl Foo.idl/<br><br>
    This produced files:/<br>
    BarHelper.java/<br>
    BarHolder.java/<br>
    Bar.java/<br><br>
    2/ $OSPL_HOME/bin/idlpp -C -l java Foo.idl/<br><br>
    This produced files:/<br>
    BarDataReaderHelper.java/<br>
    BarDataReaderHolder.java/<br>
    BarDataReaderImpl.java/<br>
    BarDataReader.java/<br>
    BarDataReaderOperations.java/<br>
    BarDataReaderViewHelper.java/<br>
    BarDataReaderViewHolder.java/<br>
    BarDataReaderViewImpl.java/<br>
    BarDataReaderView.java/<br>
    BarDataReaderViewOperations.java/<br>
    BarDataWriterHelper.java/<br>
    BarDataWriterHolder.java/<br>
    BarDataWriterImpl.java/<br>
    BarDataWriter.java/<br>
    BarDataWriterOperations.java/<br>
    BarMetaHolder.java/<br>
    BarSeqHolder.java/<br>
    BarTypeSupportHelper.java/<br>
    BarTypeSupportHolder.java/<br>
    BarTypeSupport.java/<br>
    BarTypeSupportOperations.java/<br><br>

    Now at OSPL 6.2 the required steps are:<br><br>
    1/ $JACORB_HOME/bin/idl Foo.idl<br><br>

    This step is the same as 6.1 and produces the same files.<br><br>
    2/ $OSPL_HOME/bin/idlpp -C -l java Foo.idl<br><br>
    This step is the same command as 6.1 however the files produced are now:
    BarDataReaderImpl.java<br>
    BarDataReaderViewImpl.java<br>
    BarDataWriterImpl.java<br>
    BarMetaHolder.java<br>
    BarTypeSupport.java<br>
    FooDcps.idl<br><br>
    3/ $JACORB_HOME/bin/idl -I$OSPL_HOME/etc/idl FooDcps.idl<br><br>
    This step is new at 6.2 and processes the *Dcps.idl file now produced by step 2 with the ORB IDL compiler. This produces the below files, per the IDL to Java mapping:
    BarDataReaderHelper.java *<br>
    BarDataReaderHolder.java *<br>
    BarDataReader.java *<br>
    _BarDataReaderLocalBase.java<br>
    BarDataReaderLocalTie.java<br>
    BarDataReaderOperations.java *<br>
    BarDataReaderViewHelper.java *<br>
    BarDataReaderViewHolder.java *<br>
    BarDataReaderView.java *<br>
    _BarDataReaderViewLocalBase.java<br>
    BarDataReaderViewLocalTie.java<br>
    BarDataReaderViewOperations.java *<br>
    BarDataWriterHelper.java *<br>
    BarDataWriterHolder.java *<br>
    BarDataWriter.java *<br>
    _BarDataWriterLocalBase.java<br>
    BarDataWriterLocalTie.java<br>
    BarDataWriterOperations.java *<br>
    BarSeqHelper.java<br>
    BarSeqHolder.java *<br>
    BarTypeSupportInterfaceHelper.java<br>
    BarTypeSupportInterfaceHolder.java<br>
    BarTypeSupportInterface.java<br>
    _BarTypeSupportInterfaceLocalBase.java<br>
    BarTypeSupportInterfaceLocalTie.java<br>
    BarTypeSupportInterfaceOperations.java<br><br>

    Files marked with an * were previously produced by step 2 (i.e. idlpp); note the file BarTypeSupportOperations.java is no longer produced by any step.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>CORBA co-habitation Java DCPS compilation<br><br>
    At 6.1 it was sometimes possible to compile code generated as above and / or applications like:<br><br>
    javac -classpath javac -cp .:$OSPL_HOME/jar/dcpscj.jar BarDataReader.java<br><br>
    For compilation errors to be avoided this must now always be:<br><br>
    javac -endorseddirs $JACORB_HOME/lib/endorsed -cp .:$OSPL_HOME/jar/dcpscj.jar BarDataReader.java<br>
    ...or...<br>
    javac -Djava.endorsed.dirs=$JACORB_HOME/lib/endorsed -cp .:$OSPL_HOME/jar/dcpscj.jar BarDataReader.java<br><br>
    See <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/standards/">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/standards/</a>
    </li>
    <li>Running CORBA co-habitation Java DCPS applications<br><br>
    At 6.1 it was possible to sometimes run applications like:<br><br>
    java -classpath .:$OSPL_HOME/jar/dcpscj.jar FooApp<br><br>
    At 6.2 this form must be used instead:<br><br>
    java -classpath .:$OSPL_HOME/jar/dcpscj.jar -Djava.endorsed.dirs=$JACORB_HOME/lib/endorsed FooApp<br><br>
    See <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/standards/">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/standards/</a>
    </li>
    <liListener classes</li>
    Because all classes are now properly implementing CORBA interfaces and inheriting from CORBA base classes,
    derived classes will be required to provide an implementation for all abstract operations mentioned
    in the generated interface from the LocalObject base.<br><br>
    One option is to add no-op implementations of the abstract Object base methods e.g.:<br><br>
    public org.omg.CORBA.Object _set_policy_override(org.omg.CORBA.Policy[] policies, org.omg.CORBA.SetOverrideType set_add) { return null; }<br>
    public org.omg.CORBA.DomainManager[] _get_domain_managers() { return null; }<br>
    public org.omg.CORBA.Policy _get_policy(int policy_type) { return null; }<br>
    public org.omg.CORBA.Request _create_request(org.omg.CORBA.Context ctx, java.lang.String operation, org.omg.CORBA.NVList arg_list, org.omg.CORBA.NamedValue result, org.omg.CORBA.ExceptionList exclist, org.omg.CORBA.ContextList ctxlist) { return null; <br>
    public org.omg.CORBA.Request _create_request(org.omg.CORBA.Context ctx, java.lang.String operation, org.omg.CORBA.NVList arg_list, org.omg.CORBA.NamedValue result) { return null; }<br>
    public org.omg.CORBA.Request _request(java.lang.String operation) { return null; }<br>
    public org.omg.CORBA.Object _get_interface_def() { return null; }<br>
    public void _release() {}<br>
    public org.omg.CORBA.Object _duplicate() { return null; }<br>
    public int _hash(int maximum) { return 0; }<br>
    public boolean _non_existent() { return false; }<br>
    public boolean _is_equivalent(org.omg.CORBA.Object other) { return false; }<br>
    public boolean _is_a(java.lang.String repositoryIdentifier) { return false; }<br>
    public org.omg.CORBA.Object _get_component() { return null; }<br>
    public org.omg.CORBA.InterfaceDef _get_interface ( ) { return null;<br><br>

    Alternately, for the case of Listeners, OpenSplice supplies the ListenerBase class as a convenience.
    When Listeners extend from this base class they are no longer required to implement these operations themselves.
    So a Listener defined like:<br><br>
    public class MyReaderListener implements DataReaderListener {<br>
    ... <br><br>
    could instead be defined:<br><br>
    public class MyReaderListener extends org.opensplice.dds.dcps.ListenerBase implements DataReaderListener {<br>
    ... <br><br>
    </li>
    <li>CORBA & Standalone Java DCPS API jar incompatibility<br><br>
    Previously the dcpscj.jar & dcpssaj.jar were largely identical and could often reside safely on the same CLASSPATH.
    In fact, the release.com/.bat script provided with OpenSplice placed both jars on the exported/set CLASSPATH environment
    variable. This is no longer the case - users must take care to specify the correct jar on their CLASSPATH
    when building and running applications as they are now incompatible. For this reason the release.com/.bat
    scripts no longer exports/sets any CLASSPATH value.
    </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>OpenSplice DDS V6.1.0 contains the following new features:</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>A new OpenSplice DDS deployment architecture which offers daemon-less deployment
      to go alongside the existing daemon (shared memory) deployment is now available.
      The new daemon-less library mode is what we call a <b>Single Process</b> deployment option
      where an application will dynamically link at runtime all OpenSplice libraries and
      services into a single operating-system process.
      For more information see Chapter 1 of the Deployment Guide. The choice of
      daemon or daemon-less architecture can be made by simply changing the ospl configuration
      file, and therefore does not require any application code changes nor re-generation of the application.
      Users on windows will find this particularly useful to avoid the need to find a free
      location in shared memory for the nodal administration database.</li><br>
      <li>OpenSplice RMI, a new set of APIs available with OpenSplice DDS that complement the
      pub/sub integration pattern of DDS with a new/client server pattern, but over 1
      middleware.
      For more information on this exciting new addition to the OpenSplice DDS product line,
      please see the OpenSplice RMI Getting Started Guide.</li><br>
      <li>OpenSplice Tester, a tool aimed at automated regression testing and debugging of OpenSplice DDS
      based systems is now available. For more information on this exciting new addition to the
      OpenSplice DDS product line, please see the OpenSplice Tester Guide and/or
      use the builtin help of the Tester itself.</li><br>
      <li>Support for data reader TIME_BASED_FILTER Qos Policy</li><br>
      <li>The OpenSplice configurator is context sensitive to the enabled features and will
      only allow access to attributes of relevance (for either the community or commercial edition used).
      </li><br>
      <li>DDSI2 now allows setting the multicast time-to-live for outgoing packets using the
      General/MulticastTimeToLive element. Setting the time-to-live differently for
      each multicast address is not yet possible.</li><br>
      <li>Code for a plugin for <A HREF=http://www.wireshark.org>Wireshark</A>, which
      will allow decoding of Real Time networking packets is provided. For more

            <b>New durability persistence store implementation using a key-value storage</b><br/>
            <i>
              To store durable data the durability persistency store implementation
              should be extended with a robust and fast storage mechanism
              which will replace the MMF store implementation which is known to 
              suffer from robustness issues when a crash occurs.
              <br><br>
              <b>Solution: The new persistency store implementation is based on a
              key-value storage which makes use of third-party products like
              Sqlite or Leveldb to store the durable data on disk.</b>

            <b>Default RMI ServiceDiscoveryTimeout needs to be increased.</b><br/>
            <i>
              Due to some changes in the default timing for the alignment of
              historical data, alignment takes a bit longer to start by default.
              This sometimes causes RMI to fail to locate services as the
              default time-out of RMI no longer matches the default durability
              configuration. Even though the discovery period of RMI can be
              influenced by using the --RMIServiceDiscoveryTimeout=<seconds>
              command-line option, the default of RMI should match the default
              durability settings.

              <b>Solution: The default time-out of RMI service discovery has

            <b>The durability service may crash when using dynamic name-spaces.</b><br/>
            <i>
              When a new durability service joins the domain, it may introduce a new
              namespace in the domain that did not exist on the existing nodes in the
              domain. In this situation an already running durability service may
              crash when it has a matching durability policy configured for the new
              name-space (so when using the dynamic name-space feature).
              In this situation the existing durability service dynamically
              registers the new name-space as well and applies the configured
              policies to data that matches that name-space. One of the internal
              algorithms assumed that all name-spaces for a given durability
              service are fixed after start-up.

              An issue in the product could result in inconsistent state related

            <i>
              When the durability configuration file does not configure a

              should be responsible for aligning various builtin topics. Due to
              a flaw one of the builtin topics, CMParticipantInfo, was not
              included in the namespace. Also, a policy for the namespace was
              not provided. As a consequence the nodes initially would try to
              align their namespaces, but would never reach a 'complete' state
              because the CMParticipantInfo topic could never be aligned. This
              causes the system to indefinitely try to align the namespace for

              By allowing more control over the behaviour of the RTnetworking
              services regarding the bind-address and port reuse, more advanced

              ('any'), or to the NetworkInterfaceAddress ('strict'). The boolean
              'allowReuse' attribute specifies whether the SO_REUSEADDR option
              is specified before binding a socket.

               In the case where a reader and a writer are running on different

               Socket blocking and waiting behaviour on Windows does not really

               for receiving data. Consequently, once the socket send buffer

        <i>
          A write in multiple partitions simultaneously is received by DDSI2 as a
          number of messages from a single writer, one for each partition. 
          All these message were forwarded by DDSI2 and filtered out by the
          subscribers running OpenSplice. However, this required extra bandwidth
          and besides caused other vendors' implementations of the DDSI protocol
          to report them as independent updates. 
          <br><br>
          <b>Solution: This behaviour has now been changed, so that DDSI2 filters
          out such duplicates in the vast majority of cases. In particular, as long
          as the writer, its local subscribers and the networking services do not
          run into resource limits, it is guaranteed to filter out all duplicates.
          The filter can, under very unlikely circumstances, conclude a message
          is a duplicate when in reality it is not. This requires publishing more
          than 4 billion samples with a single writer while carefully controlling
          the behaviour of the writer history cache using resource limits on local
          readers; a situation no real system is likely to ever encounter.

          the size of a shared memory segment in the wrong manner. Due to this

          When reading an disposed instance using the java API then it can occur
          that the returned sample has the key fields not set. This occurs when
          the topic contains a non key string field which precedes fields that
          are key fields.

              a nested struct with 32 fields inside one with 33 fields, &c. In such a case,
              no DDSI DataReaders and DataWriters would be created and no communication

            <i>
              TDDSI2 defragmentation buffers have limited capacity and when full
              decide what to accept and what to drop on a policy that favours
              lower sequence numbers of higher ones in case of reliable communication.
              This policy causes the buffers to fill up slowly when every now and then
              a subset of the fragments of a sample arrive, but not all of them.
              This can only happen for "old" samples, as they have will been delivered
              to the data readers and no retransmits will be requested. Under normal
              circumstances it is very rare to receive some retransmitted fragments
              after receiving the full sample, but on networks with long delays,
              reordering and packet loss, such as a WAN, this problem is quite likely
              to surface.
              <br><br>
              <b>Solution: The current solution actively drops already accepted data

              fragments of a sample while simultaneously requesting a retransmit of the

            <b>DDSI2 keyhash generation is wrong for some cases</b><br/>
            <i>
              DDSI2 always generates the keyhashes included in the DDSI standard
              (they are spec'd as optional). For topics of which the (big-endian) CDR
              representation of the key is or may be longer than 16 bytes the keyhash
              is computed as the MD5 hash of the serialized key.DDSI2 produces an incorrect
              hash on little-endian platforms for keys containing bounded strings where
              the total serialized length of the key is &gt= 17 and &lt=32 bytes. In
              practice this affects interoperability when multiple nodes publish
              the same instance:- between little- and big-endian machines running
              DDSI2- between little-endian DDSI2 and any other DDSI implementation.

            <i>
              At OpenSplice v6.1 running the OpenSplice domain services
              under the Windows Service Control Manager required the Windows Common
              Language Runtime. It also required the nomination on installation of
              a single global log directory that would hold all OpenSplice service
              and application process logs. When selecting to install the domain as
              a Windows service an incompatible 'single process mode' OpenSplice XML
              configuration file was installed by default.
              <br><br>
              <b>Solution: Installing and running OpenSplice services as a Windows
              Service now uses only unmanaged APIs so the .NET CLR is no longer
              required. A global log directory is no-longer required or prompted
              for during product installation. The installer will specify a 'shared
              memory' service configuration and will include a domain configuration
              entry to direct the log output from service processes to the Windows
              Event Log,for instance:
              <pre>
   &lt;Domain&gt;
       ...
       &lt;ReportPlugin>
          &lt;Library file_name="service_logger" /&gt;
          &lt;Initialize symbol_name="service_logger_init" /&gt;
          &lt;TypedReport symbol_name="service_logger_typedreport" /&gt;
          &lt;Finalize symbol_name="service_logger_shutdown" /&gt;
          &lt;SuppressDefaultLogs&gt;True&lt;/SuppressDefaultLogs&gt;
          &lt;!-- Change below to 'False' if you wish to log OpenSplice system log events from application proceses
              to the EventLog also --&gt;
          &lt;ServicesOnly>True&lt;/ServicesOnly&gt;
       &lt;/ReportPlugin&gt;
   &lt;/Domain&gt;
             </pre>
             See the Deployment Guide for more information regarding log plug-in configuration.
             Note that by default OpenSplice log events from application processes
             will still now be written to ospl-error/info.log files in the local
             directory, just as when not running OpenSplice as a Windows Service,
             but that this can be changed as per the comment in the snippet above.
             Note also that this entry can still be added to your OpenSplice domain
             configuration when OpenSplice is not installed as a Windows Service to
             direct service (or service and application) log output to the Event Log.

            <b>Improvements to DDSI2 network interface selection</b><br/>
            <i>
               In multi-homed systems it is often necessary to instruct DDSI2 which
               network interface to use using the General/NetworkInterfaceAddress
               setting. Until now, this required specifying the exact IP address
               of the host for that network interface, in essence requiring each
               host to have its own configuration file.
              <br><br>
              <b>Solution: New options for specifying the network interface have been added:
              <ul>
              <li>The name of an interface (e.g., eth1) is now acceptable</li>
              <li>For IPv4 networks, if there is no exact match on the full IPv4 address,
              DDSI2 will attempt to match on the network portion only as determined by
              the network masks of the interfaces. It requires that the host portion
              of the specified address is all-zero for such a match.</li>
              </ul>
              With these changes, in the vast majority of cases, there is no longer a
              need for a configuration file per host. Furthermore, a warning is appended
              to the info log whenever DDSI2 automatically selects an interface out
              of several available that have equal ranking. The ranking itself is unchanged,
              with multicast-capable networks preferred over others, then anything
              non-point-to-point, point-to-point and loopback interfaces.</b>

              Cache tool only in development scenarios, because it does not provide

              The DDSI protocol allows reliable readers to request retransmission of individual fragments
              of large samples. DDSI2 could respond with fragments other than the ones requested, which could
              generally be masked by an eventual request for the full sample to be retransmitted, but would
              cause the communication to come to a complete standstill if a particular fragment always
              got lost. For example, when the rapid (re)transmission of a large amount of data systematically
              lead to a switch throwing away a whole range of packets.

          DDSI2 incorrectly used to generate and interpret fragmented data

             unicast is used on a static port (data-port + 1), even when broad- or multicast is configured. This

             possible. This causes only the latest bound RT networking service to receive all ACK's and resends for
             any instance on the same IP-address-portnumber combination, breaking reliable communication and causing

              When receiving "best-effort" messages larger than 8kB via the DDSI2 service on the windows platform,

               Demarshalling data to a language-binding specific format may take considerable
               processing depending on the type of the data. Since demarshalling is done by the
               application thread performing the read/take, demarshalling occurs single-threadedly,
               limiting the throughput that can be achieved.<br>
               <b>Solution:</b> The C++ and Java datareaders have been extended with support for
               demarshalling with multiple threads. The number of threads used can be controlled
               by using the new set_property(DDS::Property) operation on C++ and Java datareaders.
               The property "parallelReadThreadCount" accepts a string representing a positive integer
               (e.g., "4") as value. If the call was successful, successive read/take operations on
               that datareader will use the provided number of threads for the demarshalling step of
               the respective operations.

            of the ADD_RECORD command that initiated the recording. Currently
            all interest will still be forcibly removed when a STOP_SCENARIO
            command is published but future releases will only allow interest
            to be removed by publishing remove commands.</b>

            <i>
            <b>Solution: In previous releases only a subset of the OpenSplice API was generated
              using a Corba ORB. Starting from this release, the entire Corba-Java API
              is generated by the IDL compiler that comes with the ORB. This enables
              customers to use internal types like ReturnCode_t and InstanceHandle_t
              in a Corba environment, i.e. Helper and Holder classes are now available
              for those types as well.

              Because all classes are now properly implementing Corba interfaces and
              inheriting from Corba base classes, derived classes are required to
              provide an implementation for all abstract operations mentioned in the
              generated interface. In case of Listeners, OpenSplice supplies the ListenerBase
              class as a convenience. When Listeners extend from this base class
              they are no longer required to implement these operations themselves.</b>

             DDSI2 incorrectly used to generate and interpret fragmented data message headers
             as if they were slightly extended versions of the non-fragmented data message headers.
             This caused DDSI2 to be non-compliant with respect to the standard and to fail to

            <b>Change in ReaderLifecycle QoS (invalid sample setting)</b><br/>
            <i>
               The QoS setting that determines if OpenSplice creates invalid samples
               to communicate state changes, called 'enable_invalid_samples', is now deprecated.
               Invalid samples, in the past, could either be enabled or disabled.
               There is a replacement QoS setting, called 'invalid_sample_visibility',
               which accepts three values:<br>
               - MINIMUM_INVALID_SAMPLES: Acts like the old enable_invalid_samples = true, an invalid sample will be created if there's no regular sample on which the state change can be piggy-backed (this is the default behavior).<br>
               - NO_INVALID_SAMPLES: Acts like the old enable_invalid_samples = false, no invalid samples are created.<br>
               - ALL_INVALID_SAMPLES: Currently not implemented, but in the future will create an invalid samples for all state changes even if a regular sample is available.<br>
               Using the QoS deprecated setting will cause a message to be logged to the info log. This QoS will be removed from the product in the future. If applicable it is recommended to switch application code
               to the new invalid_sample_visibility setting instead.

            <b>Domain ID change from string to integer</b><br/>
            <i>
               The DDS API prescribes a create_participant() method to create a DomainParticipant.
               A DomainParticipant is the entry-point for an application to a specific Domain. To
               be able to create a DomainParticipant for a specific Domain, the create_participant()
               call requires a DomainId_t as parameter. In the specification the type of this DomainId_t
               is 'native' meaning that every vendor is free to choose its own type. In OpenSpliceDDS
               the type of a DomainId_t was a string and represented either the name of the Domain or a
               URI that points to the location of the configuration for the Domain to connect too.
               This has now become an integer domain ID. With this change OpenSpliceDDS now complies with
               other vendors on the DomainId_t type and the DDS interoperability specification (DDS-I)
               can use it now to select the port-number for discovery for a specific Domain.
