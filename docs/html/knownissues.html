            <b>Default QoS setting for WriterDataLifecycle and behaviour do not match.</b><br>
            <i>
              The default QoS setting for the WriterDataLifecycle policy is that the 
              auto_dispose_unregistered_instances field is set to TRUE, meaning that instances
              that become unregistered are automatically disposed as well by the DataWriter.
              OpenSplice DDS will not obey this QoS setting when the application explicitly calls the
              unregister method for a specific instance. Implicit unregister of instances (like
              in case of deleting the writer) does use this QoS.<br>

            <b>IDL Preprocessor does not warn for illegal keyfields</b><br>
            <i>
              When assigning an array as keyfield for a datatype (using the
              #pragma keylist statement in the IDL), the IDL preprocessor does not
              give an error message stating that arrays are not supported as key field
              defintions. Instead, code generation finishes successfully, but at run-time
              the generated code doesn't work.<br>
              The pre-processor should therefore generate an error message when a type
              is selected as keyfield that semantically cannot function as a key.

            <b>DeadlineQoS behaviour incorrect</b><br>
            <i>
              The current implementation of the deadline Qos policy is as follows:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  when a DataWriter misses it deadline it notifies itself. When the
                  ownership policy is EXCLUSIVE the instance is also unregistered
                </li>
                <li>
                  when a DataReader detects a missed deadline it notifies itself
                </li>
              </ul>
              This implementation is not according to the OMG specification. The
              ownership of an instance is determined by each reader on their own. It
              is a view the reader has on the instance. So the behaviour must be
              changed as follows:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  when a DataWriter misses it deadline it notifies itself
                </li>
                <li>
                  when a DataReader detects a missed deadline it notifies itself
                  and resets the ownership of the instance.
                </li>
              </ul>
              Timing of deadlineQos is also incorrect. When a check for deadline
              missed is performed a new wait time must be calculated. Due to this
              incorrect timing the actual detection of a deadline being missed takes
              more than the specified duration.

              topic containing such a construct the copyIn operation of the SAJ evaluates 
              incorrectly. As a consequence it means that DCPS SAJ simply does not support non

              As of OMG DDS specification 1.0 the OwnershipQosPolicy is defined for the TopicQos,
              DataReaderQos and DataWriterQos. The TopicQos specifies the default and the 
              DataWriterQos and DataReaderQos can override this value. The policy is RxO, which states
              that the value between reader and writer must be equal in order to have writer to be connected
              to the reader.<br>
              OpenSplice DDS only supports the OwnershipQosPolicy for the TopicQos, so the DataWriter
              and DataReader take the value specified by the Topic. This is not according to the OMG DDS
              specification.<br>
              As this change would involve an API change, this change will be incorporated in the next
              major release.

        Possible problems and known errors in the DLRL profile.
        <h2>C++ language binding</h2>
        The C++ language binding for the DLRL profile is a beta version and has the
        limitations listed below. An item that is striked-through no longer is a limitation.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Deviation from the DDS specification:</b><BR> The specification defines
            an enumeration 'DCPSState' with labels 'INITIAL', 'REGISTERED' and
            'ENABLED'. The 'REGISTERED' label however conflicts with an already
            existing symbol on the Windows platform (imported by including the
            Windows.h header file). Therefore the 'REGISTERED' label is renamed by
            appending it with an underscore to 'REGISTERED_'. In later version this name
            may be changed back or changed to another name altogether, so be aware of this
            potential issue! 
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Only limited testing has been performed:</b><BR>Take note that this is a Beta
            release of the DLRL C++ API, it is therefore not fully qualified and may still
            contain some bugs other then the ones listed here. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Missing documentation:</b><BR>The Beta release of the DLRL C++ API is not
            annotated with doxygen documentation. Until this documentation is added,
            it's recommended to read the javadoc contained for the Java API of DLRL,
            as the functions behave much in the same way.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>OSPL DCG limitation:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The DCG cannot use the mapping modes 'Topic Model leading mode' and 'Hybrid mode'
                as described in Chapter 1.8 of the OpenSplice DCG manual
              </li>
              <li>
                Annotating the DLRL valuetypes with local attributes is not yet supported. See
                chapter 1.5.2.21 of the DCG manual.
              </li>
              <li>
                Typedefs to forward valuetypes are not yet correctly resolved and will lead to
                incorrect code being generated. Typedefs to non-forward valuetypes however do
                function properly.
              </li>
              <li>
                Annotating the DLRL valuetypes with local operations is not yet supported. See
                the DLRL tutorial directory for file 'WhiteListObjects.idl' which contains an
                example of local operations in DLRL valuetypes.<br>
                Note that the tutorial temporarily bypasses this limitation of the DCG by replacing
                the generated files containing the local operation implementations with files that
                have been written by hand. 
              </li>
              <li>
                The 'ccpp_Foo_impl.h' and 'ccpp_Foo_impl.cpp' files described in Chapter 1.7.2 of
                the DCG manual state that these files will not be overwritten by the DCG in 
                subsequent runs of the DCG. This is not yet functional. 
              </li>
              <li>
                The DCG does not correctly process all possible statemember types contained in
                a valuetype. Some statemember types may lead to wrongly generated code (w.r.t.
                signatures of the generated getter/setter operations or w.r.t. the semantics
                for performing a deep-copy). The following overview details the currently 
				supported types, the currently unsupported types and the types that are not
				planned to be supported.<br>

            <b>Nested modules may lead to compile problems:</b><br> In some cases the usage of
			nested modules may lead to compile issues. The following IDL snipnet illustrates the problem:
			<pre><code>
module A{
  module B{
    struct test {
      long a[3][4];
    };
  };
};
			</code></pre>
	      </li>
          <li>
            <b>Nested sequences unsupported</b><br>Any kind of usage of nested sequences will cause compile problems.
			An example illustrates:
			<pre><code>
sequence&lt;sequence&lt;long> > someSeq;
			</code></pre>
	      </li>
          <li>
            <b>Reference counting for managed valuetypes in sequences is incomplete.</b><br>
			When directly assigning an element of a sequence of valuetypes to another sequence of valuetypes
			an error occurs and the reference count of the valuetype element is not correctly increased.
			This will cause the reference count of that element to become corrupted and lead to problems.
			An example illustrates:
			<pre><code>
// Assume a valuetype A;
// and a typedef sequence&lt;A> ASeq;

ASeq source;
ASeq target;

source.length[1];
target.length[1];
source[0] = new A();
target[0] = source[0];
			</code></pre>
			<BR>
			A work-around is available though by first assigning the valuetype to a temporary holder and
			increasing the reference count manually. An example illustrates:
			<pre><code>
// Assume a valuetype A;
// and a typedef sequence&lt;A> ASeq;

ASeq source;
ASeq target;
A* temp;

source.length[1];
target.length[1];
source[0] = new A();
temp = source[0].in();
temp->_add_ref();
target[0] = temp;
			</code></pre>

              The DCG does not support the following elements: enumDef, associationDef, compoRelationDef,

              ambiguous and need further clarification in the specification. The DCG allows the mentioned
              elements to be defined, but ignores them during code generation.

            <i>
              Attributes which are mapping with the IDL types of struct, union, array or sequence or 
              enum as one of it's attributes, will result in getters being generated which return a
              direct pointer to the struct, union, etc object used by the READ_ONLY DLRL object instead
              of a copy of the object. This wrongly enables the modification of these object contents and
              thus the content of the DLRL object by use of a getter instead of a setter on a writeable
              object. A getter for these types of attributes should always return a deep clone of the
              attribute, instead of a direct pointer to the object itself.

            <i>
              The DLRL Java API currently supports a DLRLOid with an integer array
              with size 3 and name value. This array has been replaced by three separate
              integers (systemId, localId and serial). The array has been marked as 
              deprecated, as well as the constructor of the DLRLOid which takes an
              integer array as parameter. This array will be removed from the API
              in the next major release of OpenSplice DDS.<br>
              The DLRL currently supports both the three integer fields (which is the
              preferred usage) and the old integer value array (which is deprecated).
