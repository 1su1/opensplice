        DLRL IS DEPRECATED FROM V6.3. IT WILL BE REMOVED FROM OPENSPLICE DDS AT V7.
        <br><br>
        Possible problems and known errors in the DLRL profile.
        <h2>C++ language binding</h2>
        The C++ language binding for the DLRL profile is a beta version and has the
        limitations listed below. An item that is striked-through no longer is a limitation.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Deviation from the DDS specification:</b><br/> The specification defines
            an enumeration 'DCPSState' with labels 'INITIAL', 'REGISTERED' and
            'ENABLED'. The 'REGISTERED' label however conflicts with an already
            existing symbol on the Windows platform (imported by including the
            Windows.h header file). Therefore the 'REGISTERED' label is renamed by
            appending it with an underscore to 'REGISTERED_'. In later version this name
            may be changed back or changed to another name altogether, so be aware of this
            potential issue! 
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Only limited testing has been performed:</b><br/>Take note that this is a Beta
            release of the DLRL C++ API, it is therefore not fully qualified and may still
            contain some bugs other then the ones listed here. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Missing documentation:</b><br/>The Beta release of the DLRL C++ API is not
            annotated with doxygen documentation. Until this documentation is added,
            it's recommended to read the javadoc contained for the Java API of DLRL,
            as the functions behave much in the same way.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Warnings in generated code:</b><br/>Warnings seen in the compilation of the
            ospl dcg generated file ccpp_XXXDlrl_impl.cpp are known and can be ignored.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>OSPL DCG limitation:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The DCG cannot use the mapping modes 'Topic Model leading mode' and 'Hybrid mode'
                as described in Chapter 1.8 of the OpenSplice DCG manual
              </li>
              <li>
                Annotating the DLRL valuetypes with local attributes is not yet supported. See
                chapter 1.5.2.21 of the DCG manual.
              </li>
              <li>
                Typedefs to forward valuetypes are not yet correctly resolved and will lead to
                incorrect code being generated. Typedefs to non-forward valuetypes however do
                function properly.
              </li>
              <li>
                Annotating the DLRL valuetypes with local operations is not yet supported. See
                the DLRL tutorial directory for file 'WhiteListObjects.idl' which contains an
                example of local operations in DLRL valuetypes.<br/>
                Note that the tutorial temporarily bypasses this limitation of the DCG by replacing
                the generated files containing the local operation implementations with files that
                have been written by hand. 
              </li>
              <li>
                The 'ccpp_Foo_impl.h' and 'ccpp_Foo_impl.cpp' files described in Chapter 1.7.2 of
                the DCG manual state that these files will not be overwritten by the DCG in 
                subsequent runs of the DCG. This is not yet functional. 
              </li>
              <li>
                The DCG does not correctly process all possible statemember types contained in
                a valuetype. Some statemember types may lead to wrongly generated code (w.r.t.
                signatures of the generated getter/setter operations or w.r.t. the semantics
                for performing a deep-copy). The following overview details the currently 
                supported types, the currently unsupported types and the types that are not
                planned to be supported.<br/>

            <b>Nested modules may lead to compile problems:</b><br/> In some cases the usage of
      nested modules may lead to compile issues. The following IDL snipnet illustrates the problem:
      <pre><code>
module A{
  module B{
    struct test {
      long a[3][4];
    };
  };
};
      </code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Nested sequences unsupported</b><br/>Any kind of usage of nested sequences will cause compile problems.
      An example illustrates:
      <pre><code>
sequence&lt;sequence&lt;long> > someSeq;
      </code></pre>
         </li>
          <li>
            <b>Reference counting for managed valuetypes in sequences is incomplete.</b><br/>
      When directly assigning an element of a sequence of valuetypes to another sequence of valuetypes
      an error occurs and the reference count of the valuetype element is not correctly increased.
      This will cause the reference count of that element to become corrupted and lead to problems.
      An example illustrates:
      <pre><code>
// Assume a valuetype A;
// and a typedef sequence&lt;A> ASeq;

ASeq source;
ASeq target;

source.length[1];
target.length[1];
source[0] = new A();
target[0] = source[0];
      </code></pre>
      <br/>
      A work-around is available though by first assigning the valuetype to a temporary holder and
      increasing the reference count manually. An example illustrates:
      <pre><code>
// Assume a valuetype A;
// and a typedef sequence&lt;A> ASeq;

ASeq source;
ASeq target;
A* temp;

source.length[1];
target.length[1];
source[0] = new A();
temp = source[0].in();
temp->_add_ref();
target[0] = temp;
      </code></pre>
        </li>
        </ul>

              The DCG does not support the following elements: enumDef, associationDef, compoRelationDef,
              extensionTopic, multiAttribute and placeTopic. The semantics of the mentioned elements are
              ambiguous and need further clarification in the specification. The DCG allows the mentioned
              elements to be defined, but ignores them during code generation.

            <b>DLRL module: READ_ONLY DLRL objects can be changed</b><br/>
            <i>
              Attributes which are mapping with the IDL types of struct, union, array or sequence or 
              enum as one of it's attributes, will result in getters being generated which return a
              direct pointer to the struct, union, etc object used by the READ_ONLY DLRL object instead
              of a copy of the object. This wrongly enables the modification of these object contents and
              thus the content of the DLRL object by use of a getter instead of a setter on a writeable
              object. A getter for these types of attributes should always return a deep clone of the
              attribute, instead of a direct pointer to the object itself.

            <i>
              The DLRL Java API currently supports a DLRLOid with an integer array
              with size 3 and name value. This array has been replaced by three separate
              integers (systemId, localId and serial). The array has been marked as 
              deprecated, as well as the constructor of the DLRLOid which takes an
              integer array as parameter. This array will be removed from the API
              in the next major release of OpenSplice DDS.<br/>
              The DLRL currently supports both the three integer fields (which is the
              preferred usage) and the old integer value array (which is deprecated).

            <i>
              The OpenSpliceDDS-dlrl-example-guide.pdf states to run the example in the 
              following order - run_editor, run_Viewer, run_messageboard, run Chatter. 
              In Single Process mode when the command '. ./run_editor -name family 
              -add 1,mam 2,dad 3,bob' has run the entire domain goes away as the application 
              terminates. Since the data is not persisted on the disk, it will be gone forever. 
              So when the messageboard starts the data published by the editor application is 
              gone. As a result the messageboard will block messages from valid users. In shared 
              memory mode the data is still available due to the domain still being there as the 
              daemon is not shut down in between.<br/>
              The solution is to run_messageboard first, then run_editor/run_viewer and finally
              run Chatter.
